# A simple weather app

**Goal for this app is to understand how an API works with react**

This is a project I created to fetch weather information using [openWeather API :](https://openweathermap.org/api)

How it works:
User can enter the city & country name and the applicaion will fetch weather information for that city.

**This app was created using**
- React (Javascript Framework)
- OpenWeather API to get weather information
- Semantic-ui (For basic styling)

**This app is also deployed on Netlify**
